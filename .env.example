# Example environment variables for agent-arborist testing
# Copy this file to .env and fill in your actual values
#
# IMPORTANT: Tests run from the HOST, not inside containers
# - Arborist runs on your host machine
# - Arborist detects target project's .devcontainer/
# - Tasks execute inside target's containers
# - Tests verify this behavior from the host
#
# These API keys are needed for integration tests that:
# 1. Start containers (using test fixtures in tests/fixtures/devcontainers/)
# 2. Execute AI runner commands inside those containers
# 3. Verify results from the host
